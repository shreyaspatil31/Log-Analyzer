# VRV Security Log Analyzer

## Overview
The **VRV Security Log Analyzer** is a Python script designed to process web server log files, analyze request patterns, and identify potential security issues such as suspicious activity, brute force attempts, and frequently accessed endpoints.

---

## Features
- **Request Count per IP Address**: Counts the number of requests made by each IP address.
- **Most Frequently Accessed Endpoint**: Identifies the most accessed endpoint.
- **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Flags IPs with repeated failed login attempts (`401` status code).

---

## Input Format
The script processes log files with entries in the following format:

```
<IP Address> - - [<Date>] "<HTTP Method> <Endpoint> <HTTP Version>" <Status Code> <Size> "<Additional Info>"
```

### Example Log Entries
```
192.168.1.1 - - [03/Dec/2024:10:12:34 +0000] "GET /home HTTP/1.1" 200 512
203.0.113.5 - - [03/Dec/2024:10:12:35 +0000] "POST /login HTTP/1.1" 401 128 "Invalid credentials"
10.0.0.2 - - [03/Dec/2024:10:12:36 +0000] "GET /about HTTP/1.1" 200 256
```
